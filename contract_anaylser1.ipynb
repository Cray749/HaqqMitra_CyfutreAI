              "                        Found 1 instance(s): beyond the date referred to in the preceding clause (x)). 2.20.2 participations. upon the issuance or modification by the lc issuer of a facility lc in accordance with this section 2.20, the lc issuer shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably sold to each lender, and each lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from the lc issuer, a participation in such facility lc (and each modification thereof) and the related lc obligations in proportion to its revolving loan pro rata share. 2.20.3 notice. subject to section 2.20.1, the borrower shall give the lc issuer notice prior to 10:00 a.m. (phoenix, arizona time) at least five business days prior to the proposed date of issuance or modification of each facility lc, specifying the beneficiary, the proposed date of issuance (or modification) and the expiry date of such facility lc, and describing the proposed terms of such facility lc and the nature of the transactions proposed to be supported thereby. upon receipt of such notice, the lc issuer shall promptly notify the administrative agent, and, upon issuance only, the administrative agent shall promptly notify each lender, of the contents thereof and of the amount of such lender's participation in such proposed facility lc. the issuance or modification by the lc issuer of any facility lc shall, in addition to the conditions precedent set forth in article iv (the satisfaction of which the lc issuer shall have no duty to ascertain), be subject to the conditions precedent that such facility lc shall be satisfactory to the lc issuer and that the borrower shall have executed and delivered such application agreement and/or such other instruments and agreements relating to such facility lc as the lc issuer shall have reasonably requested (each, a “facility lc application”). in the event of any conflict between the terms of this agreement and the terms of any facility lc application, the terms of this agreement shall control. 2.20.4 lc fees. the borrower shall pay to the administrative agent, for the account of the lenders ratably in accordance with their respective revolving loan pro rata shares, a letter of credit fee at a per annum rate equal to the applicable margin for eurodollar loans in effect from time to time on the average daily undrawn stated amount under such facility lc, such fee to be payable in arrears on each payment date. the borrower shall also pay to the lc issuer for its own account (x) at the time of issuance of each facility lc which is a standby letter of credit, a fronting fee in an amount equal to 0.125% times the face amount of such facility lc, (y) in connection with each facility lc which is a commercial letter of credit, a fee in accordance with the lc issuer's customary commissions for such letters of credit and (z) documentary and processing charges in connection with the issuance or modification of and draws under facility lcs in accordance with the lc issuer's standard schedule for such charges as in effect from time to time. each fee described in this section 2.20.4 shall constitute an “lc fee”. 2.20.5 administration; reimbursement by lenders. upon receipt from the beneficiary of any facility lc of any demand for payment under such facility lc, the lc issuer shall notify the administrative agent and the administrative agent shall promptly notify the borrower and each other lender as to the amount to be paid by the lc issuer as a result of such demand and the proposed payment date (the “lc payment date”). the responsibility of the lc issuer to the borrower and each lender shall be only to determine that the documents (including each demand for payment) delivered under each facility lc in connection with such presentment shall be in conformity in all material respects with such facility lc. the lc issuer shall endeavor to exercise the same care in the issuance and administration of the facility lcs as it does with respect to letters of credit in which no participations are granted, it being understood that in the absence of any gross negligence or willful misconduct by the lc issuer, each lender shall be unconditionally and irrevocably liable without regard to the occurrence of any default or any condition precedent whatsoever, to reimburse the lc issuer on demand for (i) such lender's revolving loan pro rata share of the amount of each payment made by the lc issuer under each facility lc to the extent such amount is not reimbursed by the borrower pursuant to section 2.20.6 below, plus (ii) interest on the foregoing amount to be reimbursed by such lender, for each day from the date of the lc issuer's demand for such reimbursement (or, if such demand is made after 11:00 a.m. (phoenix, arizona time) on such date, from the next succeeding business day) to the date on which such lender pays the amount to be reimbursed by it, at a rate of interest per annum equal to the federal funds effective rate for the first three days and, thereafter, at a rate of interest equal to the rate applicable to floating rate advances. 2.20.6 reimbursement by borrower. the borrower shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to reimburse the lc issuer on or before the applicable lc payment date for any amounts to be paid by the lc issuer upon any drawing under any facility lc, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind; provided that neither the borrower nor any lender shall hereby be precluded from asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered by the borrower or such lender to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the lc issuer in determining whether a request presented under any facility lc issued by it complied with the terms of such facility lc or (ii) the lc issuer's failure to pay under any facility lc issued by it after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such facility lc. if the borrower at any time fails to repay a reimbursement obligation pursuant to this section2.20, such unpaid reimbursement obligation shall at that time be automatically converted into an obligation and the borrower shall be deemed to have elected to borrow a revolving loan from the lenders, as of the date of the payment by the lc issuer giving rise to the reimbursement obligation equal in amount to the amount of the unpaid reimbursement obligation. such revolving loan shall be made as of the date of the payment giving rise to such reimbursement obligation, automatically, without notice and without any requirement to satisfy the conditions precedent otherwise applicable to a revolving loan if the borrower shall have failed to make such payment to the administrative agent for the account of the lc issuer prior to such time. such revolving loan shall constitute a floating rate advance and the proceeds of such advance shall be used to repay such reimbursement obligation. if, for any reason, the borrower fails to repay a reimbursement obligation on the day such reimbursement obligation arises and, for any reason, the lenders are unable to make or have no obligation to make a revolving loan, then such reimbursement obligation shall bear interest from and after such day, until paid in full, at the interest rate applicable to a floating rate advance. the borrower agrees to indemnify the lc issuer against any loss or expense determined by the lc issuer in good faith to have resulted from any conversion pursuant to this section 2.20 by reason of the inability of the lc issuer to convert the amount received from the borrower or from the lenders, as applicable, into an amount equal to the amount of such reimbursement obligation. the lc issuer will pay to each lender ratably in accordance with its revolving loan pro rata share all amounts received by it from the borrower for application in payment, in whole or in part, of the reimbursement obligation in respect of any facility lc issued by the lc issuer, but only to the extent such lender has made payment to the lc issuer in respect of such facility lc pursuant to section 2.20.5. 2.20.7 obligations absolute. the borrower's obligations under this section 2.20 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment which the borrower may have or have had against the lc issuer, any lender or any beneficiary of a facility lc. the borrower further agrees with the lc issuer and the lenders that the lc issuer and the lenders shall not be responsible for, and the borrower's reimbursement obligation in respect of any facility lc shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the borrower, any of its affiliates, the beneficiary of any facility lc or any financing institution or other party to whom any facility lc may be transferred or any claims or defenses whatsoever of the borrower or of any of its affiliates against the beneficiary of any facility lc or any such transferee. the lc issuer shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any facility lc. the borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the lc issuer or any lender under or in connection with each facility lc and the related drafts and documents, if done without gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding upon the borrower and shall not put the lc issuer or any lender under any liability to the borrower. nothing in this section 2.20.7 is intended to limit the right of the borrower to make a claim against the lc issuer for damages as contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of section 2.20.6. 2.20.8 actions of lc issuer. the lc issuer shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any facility lc, draft, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by the lc issuer. the lc issuer shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this agreement unless it shall first have received such advice or concurrence of the required lenders as it reasonably deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. notwithstanding any other provision of this section 2.20, the lc issuer shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this agreement in accordance with a request of the required lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the lenders and any future holders of a participation in any facility lc. 2.20.9 indemnification. the borrower hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each lender, the lc issuer and the administrative agent, and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees (collectively, the “lc indemnitees”) from and against any and all claims and damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which such lender, the lc issuer or the administrative agent may incur (or which may be claimed against such lender, the lc issuer or the administrative agent by any person whatsoever) by reason of or in connection with the issuance, execution and delivery or transfer of or payment or failure to pay under any facility lc or any actual or proposed use of any facility lc, including, without limitation, any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which the lc issuer may incur by reason of or in connection with (i) the failure of any other lender to fulfill or comply with its obligations to the lc issuer hereunder (but nothing herein contained shall affect any rights the borrower may have against any defaulting lender) or (ii) by reason of or on account of the lc issuer issuing any facility lc which specifies that the term “beneficiary” included therein includes any successor by operation of law of the named beneficiary, but which facility lc does not require that any drawing by any such successor beneficiary be accompanied by a copy of a legal document, satisfactory to the lc issuer, evidencing the appointment of such successor beneficiary; provided that the borrower shall not be required to indemnify any lc indemnitee for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (x) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such lc indemnitee or (y) the lc issuer's failure to pay under any facility lc after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such facility lc. nothing in this section 2.20.9 is intended to limit the obligations of the borrower under any other provision of this agreement. 2.20.10 lenders' indemnification. each lender shall, ratably in accordance with its revolving loan pro rata share, indemnify the lc issuer, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the borrower) against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from such indemnitees' gross negligence or willful misconduct or the lc issuer's failure to pay under any facility lc after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the facility lc) that such indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this section 2.20 or any action taken or omitted by such indemnitees hereunder. 2.20.11 facility lc collateral account. the borrower agrees that it will, upon the request of the administrative agent or the required lenders and until the final expiration date of any facility lc and thereafter as long as any amount is payable to the lc issuer or the lenders in respect of any facility lc, maintain a special collateral account pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the administrative agent (the “facility lc collateral account”) at the administrative agent's office at the address specified pursuant to article xiii, in the name of the borrower but under the sole dominion and control of the administrative agent, for the benefit of the lenders and in which the borrower shall have no interest other than as set forth in section 8.1. the borrower hereby pledges, assigns and grants to the administrative agent, on behalf of and for the ratable benefit of the lenders and the lc issuer, a security interest in all of the borrower's right, title and interest in and to all funds which may from time to time be on deposit in the facility lc collateral account to secure the prompt and complete payment and performance of the secured obligations. the administrative agent will invest any funds on deposit from time to time in the facility lc collateral account in certificates of deposit of bank one having a maturity not exceeding 30 days. nothing in this section 2.20.11 shall either require the borrower or any guarantor to deposit any funds in the facility lc collateral account or limit the right of the administrative agent to release any funds held in the facility lc collateral account in each case other than as required by section 2.2 or section 8.1. 2.20.12 rights as a lender. in its capacity as a lender, the lc issuer shall have the same rights and obligations as any other lender. article iii yield protection; taxes 3.1. yield protection. if, on or after the closing date, the adoption of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any change in any such law, rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any lender or applicable lending installation or the lc issuer with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency: (i) subjects any lender or any applicable lending installation or the lc issuer to any additional taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other than with respect to excluded taxes) to any lender or the lc issuer in respect of its revolving loan commitments, eurodollar loans, facility lcs or participations therein, or (ii) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any lender or any applicable lending installation or the lc issuer (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to eurodollar advances), or (iii) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to taxes) the result of which is to increase the cost to any lender or any applicable lending installation of making, funding or maintaining its revolving loan commitment or eurodollar loans or of issuing or participating in facility lcs, or reduces any amount receivable by any lender or any applicable lending installation or the lc issuer in connection with its revolving loan commitment or eurodollar loans or facility lcs (including participations therein), or requires any lender or any applicable lending installation or the lc issuer to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of revolving loan commitment or eurodollar loans or facility lcs (including participations therein) held or interest or lc fees received by it, by an amount deemed material by such lender or the lc issuer, as applicable. and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such lender or applicable lending installation or the lc issuer of making or maintaining its eurodollar loans or revolving loan commitment or of issuing or participating in facility lcs, as applicable, or to reduce the return received by such lender or applicable lending installation or lc issuer in connection with such eurodollar loans or revolving loan commitment, or facility lcs (including participations therein), then, within 15 days of demand, accompanied by the written statement required by section 3.6, by such lender or lc issuer, the borrower shall pay such lender or lc issuer such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such lender or lc issuer for such increased cost or reduction in amount received; provided that the borrower shall not be required to compensate any lender or lc issuer pursuant to this subsection for any increased cost or reduction in respect of a period occurring more than six months prior to the date that such lender or lc issuer notifies the borrower of such intention to claim compensation therefor unless the circumstances giving rise to such increased cost or reduction became applicable retroactively, in which case no such time limitation shall apply so long as such lender or lc issuer requests compensation within six months from the date such circumstances become applicable. 3.2. changes in capital adequacy regulations. if a lender or lc issuer determines the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such lender or lc issuer, any lending installation of such lender or lc issuer or any corporation controlling such lender or lc issuer is increased as a result of a change, then, within 15 days of demand, accompanied by the written statement required by section 3.6, by such lender or lc issuer, the borrower shall pay such lender or lc issuer the amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital which such lender or lc issuer determines is attributable to this agreement, its outstanding revolving credit exposure, its revolving loan commitment to make revolving loans and issue or participate in facility lcs, as applicable, hereunder (after taking into account such lender's or lc issuer's policies as to capital adequacy). “change” means (i) any change after the closing date in the risk-based capital guidelines or (ii) any adoption of, or change in, or change in the interpretation or administration of any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the closing date which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any lender or lc issuer or any lending installation or any corporation controlling any lender or lc issuer. “risk-based capital guidelines” means (i) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the united states on the closing date, including transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the united states implementing the july 1988 report of the basle committee on banking regulation and supervisory practices entitled “international convergence of capital measurements and capital standards,” including transition rules, and any amendments to such regulations adopted prior to the closing date; provided that the borrower shall not be required to compensate any lender or lc issuer pursuant to this section for any reduction in respect of a period occurring more than six months prior to the date of such notification of the intent to claim compensation therefor unless the circumstances giving rise to such reduction become applicable retroactively in which case no such time limitation shall apply so long as such lender or lc issuer requests compensation within six months from the date such circumstances become applicable. 3.3. availability of types of advances. if (x) any lender determines that maintenance of its eurodollar loans at a suitable lending installation would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not having the force of law, or (y) the required lenders determine in good faith that (i) deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund eurodollar advances are not available or (ii) the interest rate applicable to eurodollar advances does not accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining eurodollar advances, or (iii) no reasonable basis exists for determining the eurodollar base rate, then the administrative agent shall suspend the availability of eurodollar advances and require any affected eurodollar advances to be repaid or converted to floating rate advances on the respective last days of the then current interest periods with respect to such revolving loans or within such earlier period as required by law, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by section 3.4. 3.4. funding indemnification. if any payment of a eurodollar advance occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable interest period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a eurodollar advance is not made or continued, or a floating rate advance is not converted into a eurodollar advance, on the date specified by the borrower for any reason other than default by the lenders, or a eurodollar advance is not prepaid on the date specified by the borrower for any reason, the borrower, upon notice from, or on behalf of, any lender will promptly compensate each lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain such eurodollar advance. 3.5. taxes. (i) all payments by the borrower to or for the account of any lender or the lc issuer or the administrative agent hereunder or under any note shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all taxes. if the borrower shall be required by law to deduct any taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any lender, lc issuer or the administrative agent, (a) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this section 3.5) such lender, lc issuer or the administrative agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (b) the borrower shall make such deductions, (c) the borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law and (d) the borrower shall furnish to the administrative agent the original copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof or, if a receipt cannot be obtained with reasonable efforts, such other evidence of payment as is reasonably acceptable to the administrative agent, in each case within 30 days after such payment is made; provided that no such additional amount shall be required to be paid under this section except to the extent that any change after the date such lender, lc issuer or the administrative agent became a lender, lc issuer or administrative agent results in an increase in the rate of such deduction, withholding or payment from that in effect at the date on which such lender, lc issuer or administrative agent became a lender, lc issuer or administrative agent. (ii) in addition, the borrower shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under any note or facility lc application or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this agreement or any note or facility lc application (“other taxes”). (iii) the borrower shall indemnify the administrative agent, the lc issuer and each lender for the full amount of taxes or other taxes (including, without limitation, any taxes or other taxes imposed on amounts payable under this section 3.5) paid by the administrative agent, the lc issuer or such lender as a result of its revolving loan commitment, any credit extensions made by it hereunder, any facility lc issued or participated in by it hereunder, or otherwise in connection with its participation in this agreement and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. payments due under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days of the date the administrative agent, the lc issuer or such lender makes demand therefor pursuant to section 3.6. (iv) each lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the united states of america or a state thereof (each a “non-u.s. lender”) agrees that it will, not more than ten business days after the date on which it becomes a party to this agreement (but in any event before a payment is due to it hereunder), (i) deliver to each of the borrower and the administrative agent two duly completed copies of united states internal revenue service form w-8ben or w-8eci, certifying in either case that such lender is entitled to receive payments under this agreement without deduction or withholding of any united states federal income taxes, or (ii) in the case of a non-u.s. lender that is fiscally transparent, deliver to the administrative agent a united states internal revenue form w-8imy together with the applicable accompanying forms, w-8 or w-9, as the case may be, and certify that it is entitled to an exemption from united states backup withholding tax. each non-u.s. lender further undertakes to deliver to each of the borrower and the administrative agent (x) renewals or additional copies of such form (or any successor form) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete, and (y) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such additional forms or amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by the borrower or the administrative agent. all forms or amendments described in the preceding sentence shall certify that such lender is entitled to receive payments under this agreement without deduction or withholding of any united states federal income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such lender from duly completing and delivering any such form or amendment with respect to it and such lender advises the borrower and the administrative agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of united states federal income tax. (v) for any period during which a non-u.s. lender has failed to provide the borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to clause (iv) above (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided), such non-u.s. lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this section 3.5 with respect to taxes imposed by the united states; provided that, should a non-u.s. lender which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required under clause (iv) above, the borrower shall take such commercially reasonable steps as such non-u.s. lender shall reasonably request to assist such non-u.s. lender to recover such taxes at such non u.s. lender's cost and expense. (vi) any lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under this agreement or any note pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any treaty shall deliver to the borrower (with a copy to the administrative agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. (vii) if the u.s. internal revenue service or any other governmental authority of the united states or any other country or any political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the administrative agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered or properly completed, because such lender failed to notify the administrative agent of a change in circumstances which rendered its exemption from withholding ineffective, or for any other reason), such lender shall indemnify the administrative agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the administrative agent as tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the administrative agent under this subsection, together with all costs and expenses related thereto (including attorneys fees and time charges of attorneys for the administrative agent, which attorneys may be employees of the administrative agent). the obligations of the lenders under this section 3.5(vii) shall survive the payment of the obligations and termination of this agreement. 3.6. lender statements; survival of indemnity. each lender shall deliver a written statement of such lender to the borrower (with a copy to the administrative agent) as
